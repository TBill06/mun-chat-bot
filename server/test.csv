Information about Memorial university faculty of science,Programs in the Faculty of Science,"The Faculty of Science offers a variety of programs which lead to a General Degree of Bachelor of Science or an Honours Degree of Bachelor of Science. These programs consist of a minimum of 120 credit hours in courses which include the following: the Core Requirements, as described under Core Requirements and Academic Advising, a Program of Study, as described under Programs of Study for the General Degree of Bachelor of Science and Programs of Study for the Honours Degree of Bachelor of Science, as part of which one or more Major programs shall be completed, and a number of additional courses, as described under Electives. In conjunction with the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Science offers the Joint Degrees of Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts, which simultaneously leads to both a General Degree of Bachelor of Science and a General Degree of Bachelor of Arts. The Faculty of Science also offers a number of Minor programs, as described under Minor Programs in the Faculty of Science. These are available to students completing a General Degree of Bachelor of Science or an Honours Degree of Bachelor of Science, but may also be undertaken by students in other degree programs should the regulations of those programs permit it. A Major or a Minor consists, in part, of an approved concentration of courses in a single subject area, known respectively as the Major subject or Minor subject. These subject areas may include: Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Economics, Geography, Mathematics and Statistics, Ocean Sciences, Physics, or Psychology. For the purposes of a General Degree of Bachelor of Science or an Honours Degree of Bachelor of Science, a student may complete at most one Major program from each department which offers more than one, and may not complete a Minor program from the department of any of the student’s Major programs. When a Major program may be completed both as part of the Degree of Bachelor of Science and the Degree of Bachelor of Arts, students are free to choose the degree program they wish to follow and may change from one to the other; however, they may not obtain both degrees in the same Major program at this University.",427
